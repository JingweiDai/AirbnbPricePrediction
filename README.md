# AirbnbPricePrediction
This is my course project for CS5489 Machine Learning: Algorithms and Applications. I use natural language processing method for sentimental analsis of all the houses in the NYC listings, and then use OpenCv methods to get the color tone of the listing pictures (warm - cool color tone). After these two steps, I combine other features and use regression methods, such as linear regression and random forest to predict their prices. The results show that the model works well.
